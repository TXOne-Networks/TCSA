      This sample appears to be a .NET module.

      .NET is a cross-platform framework for running managed applications.
      capa cannot handle non-native files. This means that the results may be misleading or incomplete.
      You may have to analyze the file manually, using a tool like the .NET decompiler dnSpy.
